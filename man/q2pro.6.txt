NAME
----
q2pro - enhanced Quake 2 client


SYNOPSIS
--------
*q2pro* [*+command* 'arguments']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This manual page documents briefly the *q2pro* program.

Q2PRO is an enhanced Quake 2 client designed for online play, fully compatible
with original Quake 2 servers.

Q2PRO client features enhanced graphical console, support for JPG/PNG textures
and MD3 models, network protocol optimizations, freely resizable main window,
improved security and overall performance, basic built-in demo editing
capabilities, built-in server and demo browsers.

This version of Q2PRO requires an OpenGL graphics accelerator to play.


OPTIONS
-------
Commands given on the command line start with a ‘+’, and continue until another
‘+’ or end of line. After command is parsed, it is merely passed to the
internal Q2PRO interpreter, just like if typed directly at the console or read
from config file.

Console variables set on the command line override those given in normal
configuration files. If the variable does not exist as the time it is set, it
is created for future use. User defined variables are permitted.

Some examples of possible commands follow. Complete description of available
internal commands and console variables is given in supplimentary Q2PRO
documentation, and is out of scope of this manual page.

*+set dedicated 1*::
    Start in dedicated server mode with no graphical output.

*+set deathmatch 1*::
    Enable deathmatch mode (no monsters, etc).

*+exec config.cfg*::
    Execute the specified configuration file. May be specified more than once.

*+map q2dm1*::
    Spawn the server on the given map.

*--version*::
    Show version and exit.


FILES
-----
*/etc/default/q2pro*::
    System wide configuration file. The first one to be executed.

*/usr/share/games/q2pro/*::
    Root of the static Quake 2 game data hierarchy. Non-executable game media
    like textures, models and maps are installed here, either as individual
    files, or in form of uncompressed *.pak* or ZIP compressed *.pkz*
    packfiles.

*/usr/lib/games/q2pro/*::
    Quake 2 game mod shared libraries are installed here.

*~/.q2pro/*::
    User's local data hierarchy. Files placed there take precedence over files

    Any dynamic data Q2PRO produces (savegames, screenshots, demos, downloads)
    are written here.
